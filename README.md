## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 
- JS

### What I learned

This challenge was good for learning how to create an accordion using JS. It was my first time creating it and found it challenging to add the feature of closing an open accordion when opening a new one.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn how to work with accordions using JS. Especially features of opening and closing when opening a new accordion or a close all or open all option.
